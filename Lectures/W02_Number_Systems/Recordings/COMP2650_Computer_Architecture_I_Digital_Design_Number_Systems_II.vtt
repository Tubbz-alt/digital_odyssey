quickly, and then
we'll start on new topics.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.313
Ah, OK, let's start. I mean, we
started with the stars and we

8fc25548-7046-4268-a5a9-34577762f0cb
00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:41.656
said the people in
the old days wanted to travel

34e1f1a3-094a-4f5f-a843-a835f57cb8d7
00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:46.177
between Earth and those stars to
explore the universe so they

7b8c7c87-260c-4dc6-ac75-6e70cf678d4c
00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:50.698
start some to propose some
problems and one of the most

NOTE Confidence: 0.8622057

4ca317a9-b0c2-4543-8b81-704620ed7593
00:01:50.698 --> 00:01:55.219
basic problem is what's the
distance between us and the stars?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8622057

ca0c2486-6078-4dc7-9610-af7f8640adfa
00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.096
And they said that they started to

NOTE Confidence: 0.83804244

d75c0ca5-6c30-4acc-ab7e-0d0ef8f67662
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.479
Measure the distance of Earth to
the Sun. Last session, we said

NOTE Confidence: 0.83804244

3f03baba-35f2-4425-8e25-29d51e9ad891
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.009
that let's pick the distance of the
Moon to the Sun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

491b50e8-c2ed-4514-a0d0-40080d29c911
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.105
And, what we did was that. I
mean what all the people in the old

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

d6747609-ad4e-4684-82f5-ba3e372ed652
00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.372
days did was that they
brokedown the continuous

3411db71-3310-4fa1-a4ce-373522faf06f
00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:20.002
quantity which is the distance
into discrete units of Earth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

03602376-f1f4-435a-ad00-da0f83ba1211
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:24.721
And then they start to count and
measure by the number of Earth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

d71e2a3b-120c-4df7-90ac-8cc965541a14
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.714
So by just this illustrative
image, you could say that the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

931e1b20-b4ab-4dd8-9421-db12ceb800cf
00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:33.433
the distance of the Moon to
the Sun is about, I mean five

dee58386-7c38-4ce3-b817-78ce130ff774
00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:37.426
Earth. I mean by just some error
or roughly 5 Earth.

551a875d-1760-4715-b811-82990f856228
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.682
And so that was simple. But the
thing is, that's the most

NOTE Confidence: 0.89647365

5624c358-c061-40fa-afb7-49cf0b9d6c5d
00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:47.822
important step in analyzing any
type of information. I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.89647365

cc239cda-1c14-41e0-89cb-b710b35ca587
00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:51.134
breaking down the continuous
quantity into discrete units.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8706644

f3849ded-0872-45fb-8e36-885c7934a311
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.100
So that was the birth of the
discrete systems. Computer

392045b5-904d-42c0-b745-992cb68b6417
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.604
system is just a single member
of this huge I mean category.

fb8587eb-9bb5-444b-8231-6ffae876768c
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.540
And then we discuss what are
the other types of. I mean,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

f820a195-f7f9-44a6-90ba-11dcb07f131d
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.645
what are the other quantities
that are continuous or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

adb98dc6-bb9e-4602-ad00-9a5a18e1707d
00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.750
discrete? We said that for
instance, electron is a

bb450e5f-be2b-4c00-b69f-c9aab8f85a30
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.855
discrete quantity. Time is a
continuous quantity. So in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

a0c59fdf-71e0-43ec-a8b2-1aa156b81a06
00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:17.650
order to analyze time in the
computer system, we have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

da1417d8-fbf5-447d-8246-e2c870f36429
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.100
break it down into discrete
units of, for instance, days,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

19312c38-da76-434b-86e5-22096be69df5
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.135
hours or minutes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88850224

eaa0e090-40a2-4c81-9b90-bfccdd84549c
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.160
And in particular for the image
we said that image is a

d335ad4b-916f-4927-8245-4497799373b6
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.410
continuous quantity in the real
world, because it's a reflection

2a82dec0-f160-4ef0-ac3c-ec2b84a53d8d
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.710
of light and material.

76659c34-6ca7-4a38-bbd2-8e64fd1f032f
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.230
Uh, so you must say that this
is the first image from

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

30b93b75-a983-4cae-881c-e7acbc031c0d
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.650
I mean years ago and you
could say that how can we

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

c67356ed-6407-4b58-beb7-47c1e1aaf39e
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.710
process image? Or is there a
course called image processing?

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

6d081ee0-200e-480c-986a-1917e1588e96
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.790
How can we process image in the
computer system? This thing is same

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

b8cc4ede-1298-49e5-bf85-9c8ce106f9fe
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.210
as we did for the distance, we
have to break it into discrete

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

025863f7-a50e-40c9-b352-67dc653b6750
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.950
units and the discrete units in
images are called pixels, and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

a91c5f1f-c365-4c1f-a635-0574605b32dc
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.630
process that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804659

cad595c7-1e8a-473c-aa01-7635af0559e4
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.988
And after that, after breaking
down this continuous quantity

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804659

ecf534ff-c72d-459a-bb7b-092ae6377b97
00:04:01.988 --> 00:04:06.509
into discrete units, we said
that the next step is to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804659

af865c98-473a-4500-9c30-4720641b3804
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.852
represent that measurement, you have
to write it down. So in Roman

a4b08514-12e3-4fa4-b613-8cd4ba55e29c
00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:16.373
Empire, I mean about 8 centuries
before Christ they start to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804659

1b67407d-d790-4194-ace0-2f19d7905b2a
00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:20.072
introduce a symbol for nothing,
they just represent nothing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82275254

dd06e389-7b4b-44ee-92c2-86b359905417
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.468
For one unit, they invent one
symbol called I, and then for

NOTE Confidence: 0.82275254

6e3724fe-e63e-43bf-a45d-bfcb3248fa67
00:04:25.468 --> 00:04:30.200
the next unit. I mean more units.
They just repeat that symbol. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.82275254

0e418a3e-0264-4b44-a213-11652e1a35da
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.568
for the two they put two I for
three, they put three I.

3975ce89-adcb-4c05-982c-9026aa96e6f7
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.416
And then there was another
important step in analyzing

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

c2ea6e56-bc12-4313-9a20-3377eeccc3c8
00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:43.048
information, so you first
breakdown a continuous entity

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

cbc1dd68-557d-4e10-8989-6650756e4df9
00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:48.042
to discrete units and then you
want to represent those units

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

761f52eb-6dff-4c6b-8bef-68a00b3a9ebf
00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:53.036
by some symbols or numbers or
digits. The whole process is

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

f4c36cea-a5a3-44fa-89c9-d6a978851fbb
00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:53.944
called quantization.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7811584

24abfe18-d68b-461b-a485-caa208753708
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.492
Then we said that this is
called the Unary system where we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7811584

a8e003c0-a8d7-46ef-960a-c40e9cd96fc9
00:05:00.492 --> 00:05:03.018
have only one symbol or base

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

f31c2b9e-9625-4ab9-9b44-9c314bcf26ff
00:05:03.018 --> 00:05:09.056
one. And based on this system,
we said that if you want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

2ff1d2c0-3467-4490-80c4-2148caa58afd
00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:12.986
represent the most distance to
the Sun, the distance is about

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

1a8f68c1-7f72-4273-b787-9529aab7956b
00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:18.095
12,000 Earth. So we need 12,000
positions or we need to repeat I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

2490aa1c-58e9-4535-91b0-c485846c999f
00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:22.418
12,000 times. So it becomes
about four pages. And that's a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

6a420b1c-a1c5-4a80-850f-19bbcc061aff
00:05:22.418 --> 00:05:25.955
huge number of space just to
represent 1 number, 12,000.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

48866ff7-28d6-478e-927b-0a4f3750eb25
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.400
Then we said that, is it
possible to improve the Unary

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

722153a3-44b6-4c4b-aeed-8fcf8481b6bd
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.275
system? And the answer was yes.
So that was the evolution of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

389bf98c-6efb-42e6-9d55-7c28d5f8e87d
00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:40.025
numbering system within
history. Up until now, we

104781c6-26b2-4097-ae6e-37fa8aeec5b8
00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:44.900
have 10 symbols and instead of
just one symbol, and as you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

ea80fe49-b77e-40ec-b21a-b23313b73f06
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.400
see the at first, there were no
symbols for zero, so gradually

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

d28615e0-5167-4c62-ad61-d2b9662703b3
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.775
more symbols were added to represent
zero and more units.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8703977

0907532c-915b-4f27-9905-76fda9fd802a
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.750
And after 24 centuries we have
the decimal system we are using

NOTE Confidence: 0.8703977

a92e6101-2218-43cf-b0f1-6394787a0747
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.495
right now in high school or in
the school from 0 to 9.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.044
So then I introduce my

00:06:09.044 --> 00:06:13.686
the Unary system, and we saw
that based on the Hossein's system

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637801

7bc53b45-1d95-4e36-b316-25ed01a4012e
00:06:13.686 --> 00:06:19.172
we have four symbols 0123. But we
didn't have any symbol for 4,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637801

d81d81e2-643b-408b-9264-9563c6fb7d1b
00:06:19.172 --> 00:06:25.080
so we have to come up with the
work around to represent 4 by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637801

fbd2011b-96e7-4a07-9e26-2158fc93549c
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.768
the existing symbols 0123.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723263

ec58d281-c2a8-4137-9fa7-ad64ab7cd8db
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.064
And we said that we can do this
by introducing a new position to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723263

3378397e-5edb-432d-bf49-b9beafb815cf
00:06:33.064 --> 00:06:38.498
the left or right. So then we
discuss how can we count base

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723263

f28f6be6-c8b8-44a2-9be1-0408f300be9e
00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:42.260
on the Hossein system by
introducing position to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811483

f1c119f1-15c9-4f04-a0c8-b5391bf6e664
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.170
left. And basically what we did
was that, we keep track

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811483

b0e4ee85-754b-4b5d-8070-6f5b42ac749f
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.200
of what we done so far in the last
position and then introduce and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811483

bc5346dc-0365-443b-b572-6ee6d3a83e95
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.060
start counting on the first

1bef8fbd-d9e7-49ef-8113-89cf803bf680
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.798
position. For instance,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

a2b696a0-f7d8-4f9e-88f1-8ba358576667
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:02.466
for the number 16, we said that
we do one time from zero to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

8edd5795-4271-42eb-850e-eac86000aa69
00:07:02.466 --> 00:07:06.606
three and then another time
zero to three, zero to three, zero to three and then zero.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

30494edb-80d2-419a-a77a-48cdb525df21
00:07:06.606 --> 00:07:12.402
So basically 16 is equal to the
sum of all these 3 + 0 and plus

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

f50d38bc-91c6-46fd-a1d3-a8647c3518c0
00:07:12.402 --> 00:07:16.956
number of positions minus one
because whenever we add a new

6a8f0a8e-2176-4435-a928-6eda1d550b9c
00:07:16.956 --> 00:07:19.026
position we take one step.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8875142

c51fd65c-157c-43d9-8370-bbe455e394f3
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.500
So this is my own system by just
counting whenever we are done

NOTE Confidence: 0.8875142

e58d2f7b-78a4-43dc-8ae5-140cdda8a051
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.350
with the symbols, we introduce
new positions and this is the

2746775a-16e3-4f36-91f8-d4081489ed8e
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.800
math formula we came up with.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87971675

07c2b03f-24f9-4e58-b856-d9610eb74bbd
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.164
And then we said that if you're
giving some numbers in in

b0fae1b3-0a50-42d6-ad2a-3c2b1661394b

numbering system,
what's the equal

NOTE Confidence: 0.87971675

82de831f-0c75-41d6-b3d5-51c90618ca23
00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:43.578
value in the decimal system and
based on what I said, first, we

da3824d1-92cd-431e-a1af-c3fa5fb1b3b3
00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:47.285
have to check whether that
number is a valid number and

NOTE Confidence: 0.87971675

deafebed-4fb1-4b63-af0e-3d7a1a8f6299
00:07:47.285 --> 00:07:48.970
then start converting to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.866758

ba9cb09f-86c6-4773-8668-f5ac46b6de0e
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.942
decimal system. For instance,
this number was not a valid

NOTE Confidence: 0.866758

147d9b62-b008-460f-9650-a4518ee2b59a
00:07:52.942 --> 00:07:55.903
number because in Hossein's
system, whenever you introduce a

NOTE Confidence: 0.866758

adb43e10-48c4-44d3-ba5b-ba303bda9863
00:07:55.903 --> 00:07:59.851
new position, you have to end
with the largest digit which is

NOTE Confidence: 0.866758

60cc51b2-f8e0-4da3-84b4-5f500eb61b08
00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:02.154
3. So you cannot have such a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617281

55cf5eb5-2304-47b6-b946-111ff65c447f
00:08:02.154 --> 00:08:08.620
number 303. Uh, but this was a
valid number 33331, and in order

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617281

d0793ebe-84b0-459e-8c90-8aea83ce7118
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.470
to see what's the equal value in
decimal system we have to just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617281

3ae4a184-1787-4534-8368-a5019e02da76
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.870
sum all the digits plus number
of positions minus one, so this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617281

3b1faee9-846b-484b-ba27-53b7e789657a
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.020
is equal to 17, and more symbols.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

a9ee76c3-2f7b-4c65-9aa4-033bc9a87f66
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.333
And then for any numbering
system, we said that we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

440509e1-e482-4429-8e58-c44d931848c3
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.420
calculate the minimum value,
which is just repeating the

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

6389f10d-3ac2-477d-9b7b-3e394ba5e118
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.507
zero, the lowest digit, in
all positions and the

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

d80f44de-140e-4d86-a25f-89c832384007
00:08:34.507 --> 00:08:37.594
maximum is just repeating
the largest digit in all

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

4df46777-5915-49aa-801f-3caeedc3d08c
00:08:37.594 --> 00:08:41.024
positions. So in Hossein's
system, if you're given N

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

0df3dfad-0d17-4189-ba27-64f3f6aeacd2
00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:44.797
positions, the maximum
number would be 4 * N - 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

84a42b33-38fb-40a7-bf48-6f3ca23a4585
00:08:44.797 --> 00:08:48.570
because we have to add
all the threes plus the number of

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

a31648ae-3f19-43ea-96ed-2673879447fa
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.599
position minus one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594805

7029890e-d106-4ddb-99ef-907fb990680b
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.239
So we did that and then we
saw that if you're giving 10

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594805

94352c40-0cfa-4d23-9b03-957f186f5b78
00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:58.326
positions, the maximum number
in Hossein System is going

86cbfa93-8bec-4118-b1ae-7c68fae3d927
00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:02.099
to be 39, which is a very
small number, so Hossein's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594805

b97c8731-4898-4a78-a412-68a2afd0cd9d
00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:05.529
system is able to represent a
very small range of numbers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

482839f4-4e24-4c01-950e-8797ad1dedbb
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.618
And we said that if you're
given a number in decimal

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

b554864e-21c0-415e-9357-277318a279a0
00:09:10.618 --> 00:09:14.790
system and we want to represent
it in a new number

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

f121379d-5edc-4ac6-9429-1a8a2bc73026
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.068
system such as for Hossein's number
system. How many positions do

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

f8fc92c0-47c1-41a5-81b2-52bf455b8d12
00:09:18.068 --> 00:09:21.942
we need? And the solution is that
we just take that number, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

957431f5-2d54-4b1a-9873-06309a53c978
00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:23.432
given number, as the maximum

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

0a12b70c-c34f-4cb0-92b5-12504b05d1fe
00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:27.780
number. And you already knew
that the maximum number is equal

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

2f754826-0853-4626-9781-cd54d5b8f557
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:33.332
to 4 * N - 1, so with just little
math, we keep the number of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

0b91efb5-7206-4a4c-a24e-4f5c34a24fcb
00:09:33.332 --> 00:09:37.149
positions to the right and
everything to the left. So the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

ebf1929b-687c-4171-bcd5-dfd69f7a87cb
00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:40.966
number of positions in Hossein
system in order to represent the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

e791de27-8d2e-4378-ba25-8a6d6ea3cc83
00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:44.783
number N, capital N, is equal to N
+ 1 / 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8287481

bb1e4f59-d6be-414d-baba-8ef53beabf80
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.498
And then based on this, we
wanted to represent

NOTE Confidence: 0.8287481

f25a70f0-04c8-40f0-9e5b-96ebeb2767ea
00:09:50.498 --> 00:09:54.117
the most distance
to the Sun, but this time with

14c17d92-1b04-4c35-967e-9c519575f73a
00:09:54.117 --> 00:09:58.394
Hossein's system and we saw that
it is a little bit better

NOTE Confidence: 0.8287481

136aa419-e5a6-4296-8aac-04ac2623bc22
00:09:58.394 --> 00:10:00.039
than the Unary system because

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374104

f877ab87-e2bc-43a9-9c2a-46fc7597b655
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.790
in order to represent 1000,
we only need 3000 positions and

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374104

ed16c3d8-bc57-4645-9e5e-498123c5632c
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.860
3000 position is just one page of paper, so
we can reduce 4 pages to one

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374104

0661ce04-ce58-46b8-a4b7-68def60fe6ff
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.930
page, and we said that is it
possible to improve Hossein's

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374104

2fafb933-2b89-4a98-a9d7-f5d1d9d4813b
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.610
system? I mean more, and we said
that the answer is yes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

37cee104-4d4d-4e0b-93f9-c91a88c67e3b
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.773
Instead of just keeping track of
what we passed through the

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

dc7a8616-ab3f-498e-88d8-2848e97552bd
00:10:24.773 --> 00:10:29.249
symbols, we can keep track of
the rounds over the symbols. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

685b91e7-a121-4386-abde-a3fdc2a60250
00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:33.352
when, for instance we go
0123, we done one round over

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

9bddd9f7-0ae0-4b29-8cce-76fe81e8408a
00:10:33.352 --> 00:10:37.828
all the digits. So instead of
just keeping the last digit, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

9514410d-01b7-418c-97eb-93e596d9953b
00:10:37.828 --> 00:10:42.677
keep track of the number of
rounds. So we said that we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

c715e9ab-342e-4113-94f9-b40b987f660b
00:10:42.677 --> 00:10:47.899
have this, so when we step from
three to four, we say that this is one

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

f913ba75-132a-4728-a59f-5c11c308ea62
00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:52.002
round over all the digits and
then zero, so 1 0 becomes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8899741

c01639fb-ddae-4f60-9d7c-0c2f4bdb8691
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.210
4 in this new system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

3f753bd8-44ff-4394-9dbd-05644367b16a
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.598
And the difference is that in
this new system, if we introduce a

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

155cb6c0-e21c-4a21-9e3e-3fb205864746
00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:02.670
new position, that position
has a higher significance. As

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

fa596c91-04be-40ee-ac8a-3b42e5dfd2b8
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.662
you can see here, this one means
that one round over all the

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

9f8225ed-9885-4bec-8052-40c949661e7f
00:11:07.662 --> 00:11:12.270
digits, which is four digits.
But this one is in the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

61aafc4d-e98b-4ffd-9c71-641aa874d84c
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:17.262
position, meaning that just
one is just one step. So this 1 in

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

3682a38d-5ee4-4f55-ab2b-62d9f0bcaad8
00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:21.486
the higher significant position
has a significance of four or 4

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

f155c818-767a-4d5d-9599-24c8a51437e6
00:11:21.486 --> 00:11:23.406
to the power of 1.

2561a56d-fb9c-46fa-bb1d-c4e2e46c5669
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:31.656
So we did continue this way in
order to count up until 16 and

NOTE Confidence: 0.86282784

b4830c57-3b3e-4d3a-b85f-780937d7b622
00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:36.696
then we call this system the
quaternary system which has only

5f89c5cd-15bd-42aa-a673-b54ceee1164f
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.208
four symbols 0123.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.230
And because it has four
symbols, we call it base-4 or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8514904

81289df9-f18e-4e7e-be98-8637b355f1b0
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.958
radix four symbols, and the
difference, the main

8285f96b-3127-4f81-b4ba-458a4c35973b
00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.027
difference is that when we
introduce new position, the

875efc8a-652f-4c16-942f-f0137865caa7
00:11:48.027 --> 00:11:48.709
positions have

8dce8e5a-dd58-4aa9-9b04-6aebbe49602c
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.067
significance, and because we have

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:57.038
four symbols, we do around
over 4 symbols. So the

1d34bf8b-0780-47ae-a27b-e273375255db
00:11:57.038 --> 00:11:59.926
significance are based on the
powers of four.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.804
So the first position has the
significance for the power of 0,

NOTE Confidence: 0.85461617

b2033b98-0cfd-41e8-af9f-f869621a52e7
00:12:04.804 --> 00:12:09.802
which is 1. So it's just normal,
0 is equal to 0 to decimal

NOTE Confidence: 0.85461617

28a6baaf-8dd8-465c-a3bd-6ac8db3d6565
00:12:09.802 --> 00:12:14.443
system. One same. Two same. Three
same. But when we are going to

00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:18.727
four for the next step, you have to
introduce new position

87af2a67-6b86-4305-95aa-ee6b91d8567c
00:12:18.727 --> 00:12:22.654
with the significance of
four to the power of 1.

8af71350-e207-41ab-8dfd-468f46e192d2
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.904
And then in order to come up with,
for instance, what's the equal

00:12:26.904 --> 00:12:30.288
value in decimal system for 1
0? It means that one multiplied

629a968c-9ccb-43af-a6e7-eea257af2bb4
00:12:30.288 --> 00:12:31.698
by the significance of the

00:12:31.698 --> 00:12:35.840
position. Plus 0 multiplied by
the significance of the

e3187a82-eda6-4052-b73c-78b991791047
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.120
position for the zero, so it

42646c14-7aa4-4423-8021-a108d08a9022
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.130
becomes 4. For 2 0 in base-4
system, 2 multiplied by 4 to

3a7d12f7-b386-4962-ac6a-ee7691ab813a
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.162
the power of 1 because two is
in the position with the

f44d0d6b-b509-4947-804c-d3237cd234ab
00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:51.866
significance of four to the

ade88c32-05de-4887-b188-58b339880be6
00:12:51.866 --> 00:12:53.882
So in total it becomes 8.

7ee72ed8-0f25-47d1-bb29-2af11cc4ce58
00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.220
And then new positions, 4 to the

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.755
these numbers in the Hossein

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.565
value in decimal. So for

00:13:32.565 --> 00:13:36.825
first of all this is a valid

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.305
And then when we do this for
all the other numbers, we saw

fb52210c-4c2e-464b-a9b3-108189eb93af
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.079
So by math.

e5f8babe-3a17-49e8-a14f-10dc19be5512
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:51.250
And then I would say that 4
the power of 0, 4 to the power of 1 plus up until 4

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.178
So this is a geometric series.

19255e27-b1b7-4f05-bd7b-dcedce5723fd
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.684
With the ratio 4, so just to

You can keep the three and so the

aa41e222-567c-49bb-8a46-9ead279d6573
00:19:52.664 --> 00:20:00.110

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:12.262

00:25:45.061 --> 00:25:47.287
log 4 on 12,000 + 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8865029

1fa44871-c1df-4eb4-8f66-437addb84e95
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.598
But the only issue here is that
usually the calculators have log

NOTE Confidence: 0.8865029

877f6044-147d-48e7-be7c-ca3d5fa90eaf
00:25:55.598 --> 00:25:56.750
base on 10.

6cc9ffd1-457f-4c56-93a7-69a6e745c4c2
00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.182
So how can
we apply a log on a base of

NOTE Confidence: 0.92450607

eef6f1e4-9a15-48b6-8868-f203d51dfeff
00:26:02.182 --> 00:26:05.215
four? If you are given a
normal calculator?

NOTE Confidence: 0.93816006

c5b45511-b5d1-4879-9404-f807d3f18606
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:07.878
So that's the issue.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039552

7816882c-3156-4fc8-8337-b5e8305dec67
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.468
So let's see the answer so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82121444

81fd082e-eab6-42fa-94ee-d38fc058baae
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.854
Ah, yes, actually. Travis

40c8b5cc-04a6-4863-a6de-a197fc19c182
00:26:20.854 --> 00:26:26.958
answer to that, so I'll show you
how we can apply log 4 when

NOTE Confidence: 0.82121444

97fa1d63-e07c-4bcb-b38f-0b94d7a006b7
00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:29.138
the calculator has log N.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93537

ec34eb1c-5960-4dc7-928f-32f8eb8f2725
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.448
So let's let's move
on to the answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9165812

3e206c76-db10-4019-8099-a22b519781be
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.050
OK, 50% so let's see
what's the answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876802

5854a3b6-258b-4adc-98b4-bab4f047f330
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.398
The answer is based on our
formula. We already knew that. I

NOTE Confidence: 0.876802

aba69c7c-88da-4939-994c-abba952a5260
00:26:47.398 --> 00:26:51.706
mean the distance of Moon to the
Earth is about 150 million

NOTE Confidence: 0.876802

81bf2514-f382-4f87-ab65-f3410659916a
00:26:51.706 --> 00:26:56.014
kilometers and the diameter of
the Earth is about 13,000. So we

NOTE Confidence: 0.876802

cf878e8e-e51e-442b-a893-d955590dfa7c
00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:59.963
need to have 1000. So you just
need to represent 12,000.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9007094

6834176c-b41a-4c57-a5f7-dc9bb18e2eb5
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.696
So we assume that the maximum
number is 12,000 and based on

NOTE Confidence: 0.9007094

24a08b27-6cf6-4f3f-8e14-37777fefe372
00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:08.469
the base-4, the number of
position is equal to log

8caaac03-95a2-456f-9028-b73aa9e2d51b
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.010
N + 1. N is 12,000 + 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8359816

a4deeb42-f5a2-45fd-b324-22555f9f56e5
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.884
But based on the base of four,
so the calculators has log

NOTE Confidence: 0.8359816

75fad3aa-06f9-4637-ba93-ee8958aeca2f
00:27:17.884 --> 00:27:24.002
based on the 10. So based on
math we know that log a.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8727073

61488edf-d399-4ab3-b3ed-a90969bf77f3
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.468
On a base of b is equal to log a
on a base of 10 divided by log

NOTE Confidence: 0.8727073

d2b5378a-1332-440f-a229-570fbbe0ba17
00:27:30.468 --> 00:27:32.424
b on the base of 10.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8831017

342fec34-abcf-415f-a9c2-5f1ea62b4321
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:38.325
So here we assume that a is
equal to 12,000 + 1 and b is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8831017

8654e023-5020-439f-a8c5-d33a87997904
00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:42.888
equal to four. So we can simply
calculate the log 12001 on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8831017

29196277-b643-4ccf-be2a-4c37d8bff559
00:27:42.888 --> 00:27:47.100
base of 10 divided by log 4 on a
base of 10.

3c3099fe-151d-40fe-a101-e6c02fef33d0
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:54.520
And this is equal to
4 / 0.6 and it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8979083

1bb23df1-57b8-4a2b-a7b0-cd8ee0d119d9
00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:00.540
about 6.79. Which is equal to
around seven position. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8979083

1cbf7025-7c0a-48e4-a956-1cd897163c2b
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.790
when we are representing the

323ef826-8cdb-4946-bcef-4a949cbf87ab
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.560
distance 12,000 we need about
seven positions, so less

c4093f0a-2c7d-425d-a1ac-5afd8cf81923
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.740
than a page is the correct
answer. Just seven position we

cfdef57a-6d79-4b8c-85e3-6f5b56a0314c
00:28:18.276 --> 00:28:23.050
we need seven position, and when
we wanted to convert 12,000

decimal system to the base-4,
it becomes equal to 2323200.

00:28:34.412 --> 00:28:39.326
we don't know how we can convert the

00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:44.240
other systems such as base-4
today. Today, our task is how can

e5a0ecc3-d03c-4f14-ac92-0593fcd7b9ee
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.020
we convert from decimal system
to the other number systems?

So there's no questions.

Ah, you cannot. You can say that
 we can change the number of

00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:08.368
larger number of symbols.
For instance, instead of just

00:30:08.368 --> 00:30:11.689
having four symbol, we could
have two or three symbols.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8538742

4515838f-137a-4c5f-890a-58211feacc61
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:17.702
Or in other systems we had only
one symbol, or we can have I

00:30:17.702 --> 00:30:22.746
mean 6, 7, 8 or more than that. For 
number of symbols. So in

00:30:22.746 --> 00:30:24.686
decimal system, we have 10

applies for any base, but
there's some numbering system

00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:38.169
that are very common and used in

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.250
The first one is the base-2 or
radix 2, because it has only two

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.783
So in Binary system or base-2
system we have only two symbols,

84edea15-924f-4c14-995f-4c68103f933d
00:31:03.783 --> 00:31:06.240
zero and one. And.

18b1f4bc-76db-4e4a-9b64-b7b63ae274d1
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.304
If you are given
a series of digits.

d9e354a4-aa16-41ef-8356-573cf4c16ca8
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.488
And we are, we assume that this

1ff33496-726b-41e3-99b3-13caca174032
00:31:15.488 --> 00:31:18.894
have to check that the digits
are valid. So we see that all

ad62ee64-5509-4ab7-a3bf-648db6c0d869
00:31:18.894 --> 00:31:22.300
the digits are zero or one, so
we don't have any other digits

NOTE Confidence: 0.88069266

0bb633fb-9bed-40e4-80a0-2218b01d5db4
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.444
such as two or three or
something, because we are in a

346aacc4-616f-44ce-baa4-ecd63841edef
00:31:25.444 --> 00:31:31.720
binary system. And then we have
to measure the

7d246514-e689-4318-99c4-be22cdd60828
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.560
significance of each position.

52a2f685-b620-4db5-9cb5-865072c25ee9
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.740
So from the first position to
the last position, we just

7e6542aa-f479-48f9-ae2c-b9b743f95371
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.490
calculate the significance of
the position. Because we are in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8187752

134fb853-3244-4663-be81-71ea521fb22e
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.740
the base-2 system, we have only
two digits. We do rounds over 2

NOTE Confidence: 0.8187752

0d8677f1-c5d5-4284-902c-d3e3669faef0
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.865
digits, so the significance or
based on the powers of two.

c6380fa9-824e-4b6d-9ce3-c53589e3a10b
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:58.198
So we start from 2 to the
power of 0 to the power of 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.87052476

332e5962-f099-4500-8c51-ef0e6d5f7343
00:31:58.198 --> 00:32:02.657
up until to the power of
7, so eight positions, and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.87052476

00a9357a-cdbd-4dad-8e76-e98f7f0e87f0
00:32:02.657 --> 00:32:06.087
we multiply each digit to the
significance of each position

NOTE Confidence: 0.87052476

39c4f44d-e935-4c83-a0cb-0b055d6e9e95
00:32:06.087 --> 00:32:09.174
and then we just sum together,
so this number,

2e6994d8-1d0d-47b7-9ea3-a13828f5189b
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:16.010
10101101, is equal to 173

aff3889b-5b5a-4864-948b-560d75727c3e
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:23.233
The next sample is this. We have
this number and you want to

68148da1-259d-4874-be3c-24b2f98240bd
00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:26.743
calculate what's the actual

a5196258-8110-4615-a13a-0eed74c43b9d
00:32:26.743 --> 00:32:30.253
again, we put the significance

d091ffa4-50ed-46cd-8652-53569d0231fa
00:32:30.253 --> 00:32:34.465
then we do the multiplication.
But the thing is before that we have

85b235f9-593b-4f69-9b29-984c1971409e
00:32:34.465 --> 00:32:36.571
to check the digits are valid.

6932bbca-fa56-45c4-9327-2facd8f8684b
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.472
As you can see here we have a
digit such as two and three

b57875b2-d435-44fb-aee7-428f1332315c
00:32:41.472 --> 00:32:44.860
which are not valid digits in
Binary system, so we cannot

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.940
convert it to the decimal
system account. We can say

038a164d-cba5-4326-ab62-f281638559ad
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.020
that this is not a valid

system.

e5d2e2b8-48d4-486d-a92a-aaea093c96e3
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.520
So now because Binary system is
very important in computer

1be15f19-3c1e-4c8e-9077-5638706ad972
00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.338
system, we will see it later. Let's
count in a binary system

a96fa412-c094-4eba-85d9-b07815610834
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.146
if you are given only four

positions, so, I just
wanted to share my

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.830
And let's count
on binary system.

8d43cda0-4165-4634-af24-2c3056dc9cdb
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:24.907
When I was a student I tried to
repeat this process again and

b61af779-a24e-4e4e-a48a-558e0ce5cc34
00:33:24.907 --> 00:33:30.493
again in order to just memorize
it so whenever I see a series of

22b55b9c-20c1-4da3-b7c4-839519192da6
00:33:30.493 --> 00:33:35.281
binary digits. I can simply say
what's the equal value in

00:33:35.281 --> 00:33:40.468
the decimal system so I suggest
you to do this, or repeat. This

541ba38e-fbd0-4068-9e20-0c8a05fe9b7c
00:33:40.468 --> 00:33:45.655
again and again in order to just
master the digits up until at

00:33:45.655 --> 00:33:50.044
least the last digit when we
are given four positions.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.370
So.

d378b315-80a0-43cc-81ff-3069f588038a
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.780
As you can see here we are
given four positions.

4bcefca2-ce4c-4242-8d0e-78a1f19d2a04
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.430
So the significance of the
positions are based on powers

0c12531c-af7d-469a-9868-f82a548ef2bf
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:13.358
of two, so 2 to the power of

NOTE Confidence: 0.82255703

3c511f41-840f-4f96-b363-a61373c6fdda
00:34:13.358 --> 00:34:17.054
to the power of two and two
to the power of 3.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.848
And then you start counting.

97843372-5ff9-4392-a2ef-7403cb49c3f4
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:28.044
So the first number is 0 and if
we include zero in other

NOTE Confidence: 0.8916031

1e499265-0072-4b41-b31a-0c54bd12042d
00:34:28.044 --> 00:34:32.224
positions, it doesn't have any
impact because 0 multiplied by

4f9ca0df-7d26-4296-8d86-014e5abe7359
00:34:32.224 --> 00:34:38.076
any number is equal to 0. So
this number is equal to 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8651797

b77d4a98-92e2-4028-b79b-a73647ce787a
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:43.254
So we just put here
the decimal value.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92601013

2af08643-792f-4afe-9400-0fb730deb9ca
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.800
So it's equal to 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8975619

7f75613e-1912-4ad7-8e35-c999e7141701
00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:54.118
The next step is 0 + 1
becomes one, so in all other

a5461cc3-4a29-4594-9433-24e9a19c902a
00:34:54.118 --> 00:34:55.780
positions, 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84610903

6ca1bea8-0508-4aee-b41c-7a53283172f1
00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:03.142
Next is this number plus one. So
one unit further. So this plus

one becomes one.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:09.055
So if I plus this with another
one, it becomes 2.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87849224

5ef8cdc6-15c9-437e-9a26-166d8d3173fe
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:16.250
But two is not a valid number in
a binary system, so in order to

95ee9b18-f5e0-400c-a82b-b6ec2bc039de
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.012
make it valid we have to
break it down into

a8e4db83-f8ab-4e05-b694-c0b3a514d569
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:25.980
Base two, 0s and 1s.
So we just divide 2

NOTE Confidence: 0.8707034

8083953f-c40a-42da-93c0-309b7f999210
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:32.320
By two, it becomes one and
the remainder is equal to

c0ac96cc-3fdd-453a-bbae-2be9b90d9a8b
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.840
0. So we put this remainder
on a result and then we

d1b8ea6b-cbef-4d47-95b0-f54098d209ec
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.140
consider this as the carry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.852273

9790a760-62e5-4551-9a42-f58f640ffae8
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:46.610
As we did for the decimal system
in high school, so then this carry

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.230
goes to the next symbol so that
1 + 0 becomes one.

e304e83a-e99c-46a6-bf3d-bbe077148eed
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.018
And so the other

6c49b80a-18a4-4ddd-beb5-98d12481e717
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.810
positions are zero.

b8199417-99dc-4125-8c22-df513c758e36
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:06.085
So now we have two. The next is
three, so 2 + 1. So we have to

e463d785-372b-474e-b205-03ef616cdd55
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.060
sum this with just one.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:20.870
So if you do this sum,
0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 0 = 1, 0 + 0 = 0 plus zero is 0,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90233195

05cc64c7-118d-4872-9eac-ca34aa136f02
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.930
so this is three.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.150
So.

4e457dcf-d326-4866-82b1-ab42a84b66f9
00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:36.963

So, 4 is 3 + 1.

ad3784bb-ad25-4d6a-ba2d-4412acf42649
00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:44.920
1 + 1 becomes 2, Two is
zero with a carry.

1 + 1 becomes 2 plus 0 becomes two

4720274b-9acb-4c24-bca6-495647af6dff
00:36:50.454 --> 00:36:53.788
Two is zero with a carry.

c7b6bb81-0e6a-4cd3-8198-bab70f405ba2

And now 1 + 0 becomes

ceb3c51b-d826-493c-9c04-1c15df05763a
00:36:58.648 --> 00:37:02.180
1, 0 + 0 = 0. So this is 4.

435bf7cc-f8a3-4c93-bb89-074bce532e49
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.915

applied here too in order to

f8440c55-2c46-40da-8fee-1ac8126d9c55

binary system when
we have four positions.

4538ef53-2ef5-4654-b4b8-d2bcfab4cbe0
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.468
So let me go back to the slides.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.450
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9316554

02b8347a-c4f2-4f42-8a0c-a97b07970b8f
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:54.840
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88936025

f85277d6-1cf5-48b3-b2a7-5ba3adbcb519
00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.469
So let's move on to the next

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

5d4e509a-57c8-4720-8ec3-e47398fe802d
00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:04.086
numbering system. So we already
covered the base-4, so we

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

2c69b01e-ca1a-436b-86ed-065c4e9fb993
00:40:04.086 --> 00:40:09.462
have base-2, base-4 and now
we have base-8 where we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

8792bbe5-2b5a-4a54-bc16-61b95edeea0b
00:40:09.462 --> 00:40:14.454
only 8 digits from zero up
until seven. Again. As you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

7a6d296a-46e3-49fb-a693-b89c45d3b995
00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:19.446
see here, the largest digit is
number of the base minus one. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

cbc4ffaa-ca76-492a-b40f-752f4fc7ba70
00:40:19.446 --> 00:40:24.822
8 - 1 becomes 7, so that's the
largest digit. So in order to

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

8cd39fd3-d618-491c-8ea8-dc6fec58837b
00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:28.278
have maximum number we have to
repeat this data.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88877636

f374fbb4-cb40-4d55-8f50-4d1fcd541adc
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.090
So the same rule
applies. So imagine you are

a72990f2-be8a-4d45-9dd4-249aeee4aa06
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:37.650
given this number this time
in base-8. First of all, this

NOTE Confidence: 0.88877636

cc3e7ea9-62a1-46de-9d38-be58043c9f9e
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:41.450
is a valid octary number
because all the digits are

NOTE Confidence: 0.88877636

628ce0a7-ec58-4254-924e-f6141ddd5feb
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:42.970
between zero and seven.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852636

ab7e1071-2380-4a17-8dc8-de84f173a80f
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:49.002
And in order to see what's the
actual value in decimal system,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852636

7bd683f2-f697-4d79-9d41-42f865336533
00:40:49.002 --> 00:40:52.712
we just have to calculate the
significance of the positions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852636

eb1a83f0-4a6c-4c6f-a819-2caa4ef3f885
00:40:52.712 --> 00:40:57.164
Because we are in the base
8, we do rounds over 8

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852636

2cdd1ad4-d4bf-41de-8ed8-524a875dd2eb
00:40:57.164 --> 00:41:01.245
digits. So the significance are
based on the powers of eight.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8939892

ed50fa43-2e67-4c34-8a73-9c181b01659a
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.000
So from 8 to the power of 0, 8 to
the power of 1 up until 8 to the

b7885e5e-abd4-4cb0-bded-f01a158c8ae5
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.865
power of 7. And then we do
multiplication with each digit

baf40700-5073-46fe-86eb-3785ea890da1
00:41:09.865 --> 00:41:12.880
to the significance of the
position and then sum.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.816
So this is the actual value,
57 million something for the

6871eea6-5d12-4ad7-809c-9d8951a316da

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.748
As another example, if you are
given this number in base-8,

00:41:30.748 --> 00:41:35.480
again you have to 1st figure out
if the numbers is a valid number. As

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.930

which are not valid

because although we are in

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.172
digits are 0, 1 up until 7,
so be careful about this when

f9462f39-36da-41ed-a633-5b90362bb73d
00:41:59.172 --> 00:42:00.696
you are doing calculation.

b63b7deb-5c97-43a0-8313-2decb2e12d70
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:05.998

00:42:05.998 --> 00:42:10.006
final exam. So when you are
given for instance in base-2,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8692453

4d79c98c-e334-472c-b377-a82bfb82ee8d
00:42:10.006 --> 00:42:14.682
the last digit is one. In base-4, the
last digit is 3 and in base

b27458b7-1583-47c5-ad68-9bebdc5e94f1
00:42:14.682 --> 00:42:18.356
eight the last digit is 7. So be
careful about that.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.154
And the same binary digits we

the base-2, we wanna see if
we are given the same number in

00:42:29.434 --> 00:42:33.658
the base-8. What would be
the number? So this is the

each digit to the significance

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:30.760
count 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and then when

bfbdb7f3-994c-4bba-a53c-37680892d9c6
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.433
you simply have to

91bf4f64-84d6-4fe2-bbb5-007240a2d8dd
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:59.934
divide 8 by 8, so it's equal

f80cb246-63df-4fc1-ae98-31e266986cbb
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.152
zero, so you put the remainder

2a83603a-d287-43bb-9445-0fc1641aefa2
00:45:04.152 --> 00:45:10.677
here. And then put the quotient
as they carry to the next

28e60483-6f99-4aea-bbcb-552980efc387
00:45:17.138 --> 00:45:22.605
no carrying, so 0. So eight
becomes 10 in base-8, the

00:45:22.605 --> 00:45:30.557
next number is going to be 9. 9 is 8

b60aa618-678e-48ae-ab6f-8cbc857727a4
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.846
So let's go back to the slides.

So.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.812
This is base-8 and the next
is base-10 and we already are

00:46:19.812 --> 00:46:23.842
familiar with the decimal
system. We have 10 digits from

00:46:23.842 --> 00:46:29.081
zero, again, 10 - 1 becomes 9,
so the largest digit is 9.

c4910495-d467-4df5-b696-af6434edd116
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:35.090
And this is the system

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.340
Again, if you're given this
number in decimal system, we

ab2af11b-cd1d-4cba-b21f-dc9c7f2ce812
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:07.004

00:47:07.004 --> 00:47:11.999
we are in the base-10, so it's
based on the powers of 10 and

96953d55-5f5e-45c1-8e6b-161d1092b4aa
00:47:11.999 --> 00:47:15.329
then we multiply each digit by
the significance of the

00:47:17.993 --> 00:47:22.655
because we are in the base-10
so the powers of 10 is the

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.010
The interesting
thing is that when you do this,

52d1a057-1c0a-417d-8b5b-48c4b73cde6a
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.340

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.670
30,302,131 is equal to 30,000,000
something in decimal. So when

af122f32-28ce-4bb5-b255-2fdc030ec1c2
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:43.866

00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:46.031
numbers. So in decimal system,

f718edd9-ec45-4153-a454-6df141742323
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.820

00:47:53.524 --> 00:47:56.904
converting the decimal to

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:04.124
The same digits of Binary. I

00:48:04.124 --> 00:48:08.996
for the base-2 base-8 in
the base-10. You don't need any

c6e269d0-5253-4bc4-8dae-3c09e588f314
00:48:08.996 --> 00:48:13.172
calculation because you will end

c2f682b2-ec47-4f12-8a2c-bc6923d065d9
00:48:13.172 --> 00:48:17.395
10,000,000 something. So it's
not just doing the calculation,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8933192

9caecc5d-1cda-4f7f-af16-525529332e3d
00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:21.850
you can just say that this is
equal to decimal number 10,000,000

NOTE Confidence: 0.8933192

8184e91a-014d-40f1-854f-301df97d63fe

something in decimal system.

f465c83e-7967-4ce0-9930-d14cdabc95bb
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.480
But again, when you compare
the same number 10101101 in

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.620
base-2 base-8 and base-10,
you can see that.

e41e7fa0-6688-454c-85f2-5fa36bb87da8
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.952
in base-8. You can, uh, have a
higher value for the same digit.

08705c10-4c93-47b0-ad2d-45c66cb8f6fc
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:46.752
This is equal to 173. In
base-2 it's about 2 million in

2f39225d-cbd6-4b66-8b75-568493ec65c4
00:48:46.752 --> 00:48:50.525
base-8, but the same number

50ebf5fc-40e2-4ded-afe2-d02e962d5437

Something in base-10.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.764

you are given this number again,

53f74652-74eb-4a06-8c53-cd6ad2facd6a
00:48:58.764 --> 00:49:02.808
you have to check first if the

00:49:02.808 --> 00:49:07.863
because we have a A is not a
symbol in base-10, so this is

2bb4a15c-297a-4067-8e5e-7c8e5406a1f9
00:49:07.863 --> 00:49:09.211

cd60dfa8-0807-45b2-9f4d-b4db6d87ab1a

a next digit is BCDEF.

d72529db-63fe-4af3-887b-67d4f53c1ce0

de71e6fb-bd55-43b5-b06e-5bd26bff3d56
00:50:06.344 --> 00:50:10.998
which is 15. So in this system
when they represent 15 they put

c382e233-8bd4-459a-bb2d-2ed7b9204ee3

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.875

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:36.098
because  We are in the base

00:50:36.098 --> 00:50:41.702
based on the powers of 16. So we
first calculate the significance

NOTE Confidence: 0.8823922

c40aa95b-5a40-4cf3-82b2-ba8859d0549f
00:50:41.702 --> 00:50:46.839
and then we multiply each digit
to the significance of the

539784c1-8895-403d-a0db-27aed9852b53
00:50:46.839 --> 00:50:49.641
position and then we all sum

a2c64cb5-a82c-4565-a489-6cbf036ae331
00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:55.678
together. You might wonder how
can we multiply a by 16 to the

00:50:55.678 --> 00:50:58.102
power of five, as I said.

40daa04a-409c-45bf-b458-85e8469a03aa
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:00.548
A is 1.

cd46b68e-bc94-4995-acdf-efc55f39b471
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:07.115
Step after 9 so it becomes 10,
so the actual value of a is 10.

fa185078-da85-4476-b449-6bae1b5d1825
00:51:07.115 --> 00:51:12.533
So you can convert A to 10 and
then multiply 10 by 16 to the

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:31.880
Again, if you are, if you see B,B
means next step after a which is

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:51.220
So we have 4 one.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.599

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:33.490
So because we are in Radix 2,
the first I mean option is not

NOTE Confidence: 0.84925944

d995b691-91d6-4d65-b95a-608197f9cba8
01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:37.945
correct because we have digits
more than one so the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.84925944

3fc8f45b-c553-4fcd-9a38-b112d35e554a
01:00:37.945 --> 01:00:42.805

1112, but this is not a valid

number in Radix 2.

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:48.780
Also this one. So the first
choice is not correct.

8ae2e4a0-293b-4709-9f3e-7d2522278b7a
01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:53.344
The last choice also is not

a valid number radix too, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8691389

c2bc28a4-5a6c-4b0c-b687-99231657f9be
01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:59.938
the only options are the
second and third option.

167a294c-7507-46e4-bcb8-2208cbf695d5
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:01.900
So.

808eb373-317d-4706-b311-e4cc7cdfdc92
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:09.597
When we do this calculation, so

And let's see what's the answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7827548

3c18cc34-ba91-49ba-823d-6f5b7112628e
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:32.594
So 1111 you wanna do the
next number so we have to

77f758b3-e878-4142-8a96-d43f6005f8e0
01:01:32.594 --> 01:01:34.460
plus this why?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7170109

a768065d-201a-4606-bca8-24404227edbd
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:35.920
Digit 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9027865

02623413-14bb-434f-8ef1-06192f84c859
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:44.070
So 1 + 1 becomes 2, Two is not a
valid digit, so we have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9027865

c0b195ae-af9d-4c2a-8fdc-8e1a1ac4c000
01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:49.245
divide it by two because we are
in the base, two is equal to 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.9027865

c9434d1e-fa2c-493c-bed4-ab7f0ec72166
01:01:49.245 --> 01:01:50.970
and the remainder is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86368513

0cc6a15c-3459-4cfa-ad31-47269eb434c0
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:56.216
So we put the remainder here and
then the quotient goes as they

f150b945-2dd8-4ad5-aab0-a550c0c2e236
01:01:56.216 --> 01:01:57.926
carry to the next position.

1741490e-a6bd-4ade-8854-de53448e0a0f
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:05.292
And then one plus one 2 + 0
becomes two again, 2 cannot be

1a134ffa-a0a2-44b4-b9c1-884316d467b1
01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:10.428
represented here. You have to
break it into based on the base

9c3b1586-6ddd-4495-baac-f38e0dd0f885
01:02:10.428 --> 01:02:15.564
two, so divided by two becomes
one remainder is 0, so again

84bada3f-5745-4120-a9b4-c45e995cd504
01:02:15.564 --> 01:02:17.704
remainder and Carrie goes here.

d60af6f9-e231-44c2-ae93-91203e7f1958
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:24.298
Again, 1 + 1 two plus 0= 2,2 is
equal to zero with a carry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83997405

1f18dbb1-fd4e-4c57-b368-304c7679c086
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:33.150
1 + 1 two plus
0=2 So 2 is zero with a carry.

97f7a769-72ef-4cde-b26c-5a46615d46be
01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:41.557
This is the last carry 1 + 0
+ 0 becomes one so.

b0f16a86-a344-42b2-97e6-7516c280e9a6
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:48.084
It becomes a 5 digit
number 10000 and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962182

9c067dee-154e-430f-93b2-562fbb3c2c59
01:02:48.084 --> 01:02:50.428
the next number is.

246de867-40bb-4031-94c7-9b946e0ff523
01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:56.994
Because we are looking for the two
digits, the next two digits. So we

02367554-f3cf-42b9-a2c3-170d5d055c64
01:02:56.994 --> 01:02:58.799

e6da6c6c-323f-45ed-b0f6-ee7a26fd449d
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.792
Be careful we are in the radix

4b595427-86f9-4985-813e-1da0404ed51b
01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.270
Two is a valid digit.

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:12.380
So this time we have.

121dc1ce-9fbf-4fd9-9d04-62188552293a
01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:15.860

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:25.439
We have 1111, but this number
is in the base 3.

eae8956c-9df9-4ce6-b193-ce912ac37814
01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:36.835
So 1 1 becomes 2, but we can use
the digit 2 because we are in

3b53c5dc-c4cb-4288-9525-6b1c8167bbd5
01:04:36.835 --> 01:04:39.516
Radix 3. So we put two here.

34dc52aa-c77d-47ec-b9e1-0ecda3d030f8
01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:44.240
101101101 so this is the

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.178

01:05:00.518 --> 01:05:06.263

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.236
Divided by 4 because we are in
base-4, each subsection is

5ecf9870-c4e9-44be-9704-2e4d84f00d33
01:14:31.236 --> 01:14:33.740
half the value 4 to the power of

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:40.690
minus one. 2 times 3 times and four
times. So when we are in the 4 *

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:43.698
1 / 4 is equal to 1 unit.

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:49.350
So then we can represent the
distance of Moon to Sun a little

NOTE Confidence: 0.85218674

7950e633-61c1-4a68-a099-60799fcca71d
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:52.760
bit more precise. So we could
say that the distance is.

8aa735fc-3141-47a2-babf-2106a6b8a575
01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:00.619
123410 is equal to four in base

854ed545-7147-41f2-9fce-4a8d601d0154
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:15.640
If we need more precision.

133efa6b-6f80-4fbd-a621-f0989a487e28
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:21.873
We can split that, I mean a
subunit into more sub sub units

NOTE Confidence: 0.88279593

13d9f561-b281-4549-a351-96a53b194ccc
01:15:21.873 --> 01:15:27.216
or that 1 / 4 divided by another
four subsections. So we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.88279593

f95bd1c4-dad2-40da-9fd7-8e234227408a
01:15:27.216 --> 01:15:33.792
simply do this so this time it
becomes 1 / 4 / 4 which is equal

NOTE Confidence: 0.88279593

5c2d4b03-6384-481d-80cc-64867d1b89c0
01:15:33.792 --> 01:15:39.957
to 1 / 16(1/8 is a mistake) which is equal to 4
to the power of minus 2.

2afb5f42-a689-45d9-807a-e13eb8aae801
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.545
So if you start with the
smallest portion, now we have.

2093cf3f-d663-4bc4-8bd8-81442c6e9228
01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:51.630
One section over 8 subsections,
so it becomes 01 or this is

91065993-07e3-4369-9c92-fbf97d0ee07c
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:57.090
equal to the significance of

3. 4 four means just one
subsection out of four sections

3a793e2e-3134-480e-97f8-46057ddd883c
01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:14.030
subsections. So it becomes this.

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:19.760
So now we can represent the

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.178
precise. You could say that the
distance is 4, two, 1 / 5 and

15c0a40b-6574-42a4-84d9-772cf3341ee0

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:37.926
So if we need more precision, we
have to break it more, so we

f8e5d1e4-1197-4b88-baa3-81bca0cdf094
01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:41.514
have to introduce more position

decreases by the powers of

negative powers of four.

c7ec3789-e441-4417-9937-8c6fcf7a69ec
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:56.446
So imagine we have this here.

b222f864-a8de-4d78-a513-6e20ae3c08eb
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:59.415
You have integral part an

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:04.040
fraction part. So in the
integral part we do the same as

8a3cc713-59bc-440a-a447-8aebc87a9352
01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.808

f35806a7-624d-4acf-b2fe-913c8527226b
01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:22.135
As you can see here, for the

dd9ce6da-540f-40de-99a6-c96c2b4fe4cc
01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:33.282
The same we just multiply each

altogether. So in the right

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:49.208
integral part. So for the zero
and the next step you have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300456

f836ab41-11e9-43fe-8bf5-260067f739bd
01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:53.088
increment this by a unit of
increment infractions, so the

01:20:53.088 --> 01:20:56.968
next is this which is equal to
zero point 125.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056802

a3af3ee2-a1e8-4586-a79d-e2d6a6fa7098
01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:02.630
And then the next is this 1 *
2 to the power of minus two

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056802

58e26e63-284e-4f86-bd2e-361692abda89
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:03.942
plus all the zeros.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8805343

aa8ad3d9-21e0-4c54-a7ad-1faf638f58ae
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:10.355
So you can see that as from zero
it goes to zero point 125 and

15546a6d-58b1-4f0d-babf-238b8755c46f
01:21:10.355 --> 01:21:12.485
then it goes to 0.25 etc.

7a77f47a-df1e-4035-a2fb-50f1af40f77e
01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:16.552
And when you are done with the
old available numbers in the

dab45426-ca96-4721-9b7e-9d3d942cb903

de455e5c-9bf2-4c3d-a36a-3eed84482268
01:21:18.298 --> 01:21:24.354
one. So from zero to one you
can have these numbers this

6729fdb1-c8bd-4401-b302-429abd64cd60
01:21:24.354 --> 01:21:29.704
fractional numbers. So these are
the fractional normal in base-2.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.568
OK, so then we have to sum it.

01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:44.770
The Slash Plus B is means that
63 + 1 becomes 64.

01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:50.378
But we are not allowed to
represent 64, so we have

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.580
So we keep the remainder.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.186
And then they put a carry to the
next position. So this Carry is

f655c44b-b397-4bde-9ade-38ede4b8db0c
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:45.996
And B is 1, so 1 + 25
becomes 26 + 0 becomes 26.

ba538e60-ba08-4ff0-b4b9-4a8ed3120532
01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.760
